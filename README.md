# adventofcode2021

These are my answers for the [2021 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

I wasn't intending to take part in this after the time I wasted last year, but...
I quite like programming. I'm not good at it, but I enjoy it. So we'll see how we go.

Answers are structured by language (Python, Go, Rust) and named by day. I'm
expecting there to be 2 parts per day (most days) as there was last year. I could
of course be wrong.

## Python
  * `python/day1part1.py` - simple, incremental-from-read answer.
  * `python/day1part2.py` - I'm embarrassed how long it took me to come up with a
  way to do sliding-window addition but I did at least make my solution scalable
  to any window size. Always with the off-by-one errors...

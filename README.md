# adventofcode2021

These are my answers for the [2021 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

I wasn't intending to take part in this after the time I wasted last year, but...
I quite like programming. I'm not good at it, but I enjoy it. So we'll see how we go.

Answers are structured by language (Python, Go, Rust) and named by day. I'm
expecting there to be 2 parts per day (most days) as there was last year. I could
of course be wrong.

If I find the problem itself interesting or if I run out of time, I'm less likely
to tackle it in other languages. This ought to be obvious from the listing below....

## Python
  * `python/day1part1.py` - simple, incremental-from-read answer.
  * `python/day1part2.py` - I'm embarrassed how long it took me to come up with a
  way to do sliding-window addition but I did at least make my solution scalable
  to any window size. Always with the off-by-one errors...
  * `python/day2part1.py` - Very simple algorithm but that was all that was required.
  Actually I implement an unused instruction - `back` to go backwards. Ho hum.
  * `python/day2part2.py` - Only really a minor elaboration of the part 1 solution
  although I removed the redundant instruction, and added an unasked-for guard
  condition to prevent the submarine breaching.
  * `python/day3part1.py` - Journeyman bit-bashing, not very elegant but does the
  job. Interesting fact: Comes up with complete garbage if you feed it the day 2
  input...
  * `python/day3part2.py` - First occurrence of recursion this year. Spent way too
  long bit-bashing binary to decimal and the final solution is both ugly and inefficient.
  (first optimisation: 1 set of recursion to find both values.)
  * `python/day4part1.py` - As much an exercise in parsing as anything else, although
  there's quite a lot of bookkeeping done too. Solutions fairly mechanical but it
  does work. Couple of list comprehensions in there to make it look vaguely on-brand.
  * `python/day4part2.py` - You've tried Bingo, now try Anti-Bingo. A fairly simple
  inversion of the completion criteria from part1 made this a quick (if still horribly
  ugly) answer.
  * `python/day5part1.py` - Anticipation of a Part-2 extension means my line-drawing
  algorithm is more complete than needed to get the right answer for part 1.
  * `python/day5part2.py` - YES, finally I predict the part2 problem correctly.
  Differs from part 1 by a single IF clause to now plot diagonals.
    * Extra Credit - `python/day5part2_extracredit.py` produces visualisations
      of the answers to part 2. Output for my data [visualised here](https://www.guided-naafi.org/aoc2021/2021/12/05/VisualisationOfAOC2021Day5Part2.html)
  * `python/day6part1.py` - Simple iterator algorithm, gets the answer in a second.
  Look, I can tell part2 is going to go all algorithmic-explosion, I just can't see
  how yet. Let's go have a look...
  * `python/day6part2.py` - Ah there it is. Amazing how finely-tuned that input was
  so that part 1 is "easy" but part 2 is "hard". Fortunately, fish fall into discrete
  age ranges so we can put them into buckets by age and work with them en masse. As a
  result, part2 executes 20 times faster than part 1 even after extending 80->256 days.
  * `python/day7part1.py` - Fairly simple algorithm but uses arrays not lists and also
  has an optimisation to only search occupied positions ONCE no matter how many crabs
  are in it. And of course we all know part 2 has the algorithmic explosion coming....
  * `python/day7part2.py` - It seems we can "get away" with a simple solution-space
  search algorithm provided we take a couple of steps to optimise. Feels like I've
  missed a trick to turn this trivial, not least of which will be that I'm a bit of a
  donkey calculating the cost step-by-step when it's clearly a series. *UPDATE:* oh
  yes, of course. It's a number series we need over and over. Pre-calculating it
  and having it as a lookup table makes _complete_ sense. Execution time drops from
  1 min 16 seconds to 0.58 seconds, a very worthwhile optimisation.....
  * `python/day8part1.py` - Leaving all the extraneous working in-place because this
  is an abject lesson in **read the whole exam question before answering**. Part 1
  question is a lot simpler than the expected "decode the sequences" question I was
  expecting. That'll be part 2....
  * `python/day8part2.py` - Here it is. This is a purely mechanical approach, which
  explains why I took so long, and even then it contains a heuristic approach (read:
  it works but I can't explain why) to decoding 6-segment and 5-segment numbers.
  As a final note as to how _wrong_ I went: my boy beat me by over an hour to the
  solution after starting way later.
  * `python/day9part1.py` - Bit of a better start. The Adjacency rules are actually
  making the code _more_ complicated than it needs to be, but I'm pretty happy with
  the discriminator code I came up with to do it (much better than mechanical `if`
    clause testing for boundary conditions). Now can I beat Adam to part 2...
  * `python/day9part2.py` - Missed a trick (originally) that the "growth algorithm"
  I use to find the boundaries of basins should _not_ use diagonals and therefore
  shares an adjacency-test with the part1 answer I'd already proved correct. Some
  refactoring thus occurred. Also, the working actually stores/calculates way more
  detail than the solution needs as a legacy of me checking my working.  But, in the
  end a reasonably "clean" approach and fast-calculating answer. If I had time I'd
  definitely do a visualisation of the heightmap and it's contours/low points.
     * `python/day9part2_extracredit.py` - strictly speaking I _didn't_ have time,
     but this was too delicious to pass up. Output and explanation on t'blog [visualised here](https://www.guided-naafi.org/aoc2021/2021/12/09/VisualisationOfAOC2021Day9Part2.html)
  * `python/day10part1.py` - For something that ought to be a simple parser this took
  WAY too much time. I needed about 3 run-ups to get the recursive token finder
  algorithm correct. And I've still bodged the exit conditions. _And_ I don't think
  this helps me with part 2 very much either....
  * `python/day10part2.py` - OK, part1's method got me a lot closer to the solution
  for part 2 than I was thinking it was, a bit of futzing with the recursion closure
  bookkeeping (I'm not proud of this, it's not good coding practice, it just...works)
  and a lot of phaffing around with the daft scoring mechanism (and working out an
  off-by-one line termination clause I'd missed in the part1 solution) and boomshanka.
  * `python/day11part1.py` - coding in a YHA using wet string networking edition.
  Hampered by an odd keyboard, weak internet, and the fact that I'm here
  with friends in Derbyshire and doing stuff like walking etc instead of
  coding. Answer took much longer to code than it should, also the fact
  that I mis-read the "clamp to zero until end of step after flash"
  condition, but the final answer is _sweet_.
  * `python/day11part2.py` - This one looked too good to be true, I was
  sure it was one of those Combinatorial Explosions In Disguise they love
  so much but, no, it was a genuine gimmie. A very simple adaptation of
  the part1 answer and the solution presents itself in moments.
    * `python/day11part2_extracredit.py` - Long day spent out of doors, too frazzled
    to even tempt myself with today's challenge, instead a simple sequence-of-still
    images-making-up-a-movie animation of yesterday's answer published to the blog
    [here](https://www.guided-naafi.org/aoc2021/2021/12/12/VisualisationOfAOC2021Day11Part2.html)
  * `python/day12part1.py` - Depth-first route finding solution. Not bad. Got beef with
  the final question specification which _appears_ to add an additional condition but
  actually doesn't.
  * `python/day12part2.py` - Just enough of a rule-change to make you _think_ it's
  gone all combinatorial-explosion but it turns out the answer's not massively
  over-complex anyway. I'm sure there's optimisations possible but I don't think
  it's worth the effort looking for them.
  * `python/day13part1.py` - Interesting little problem. Suspect I've mostly
  solved Part2 but we'll see after we run it again. Fairly sparse grid though.
  * `python/day13part2.py` - Yup, solved by part1 working with the simple removal
  of a `break` statement. Big appreciation to the AOC master Eric Wastl for the
  problem and the input sets, that's a lot of fun to solve and _extremely_
  satisfying.
    * `python/day13part2_extracredit.py` - Another day's solution absolutely
    screaming out for a visualisation. So here's one that scales the folded grids
    back to a common size and dumps a PNG per fold which is later assembled into
    a WEBM using `ffmpeg`. View the result [here](https://www.guided-naafi.org/aoc2021/2021/12/13/VisualisationOfAOC2021Day13Part2.html)
  * `python/day14part1.py` - Another iterative solution. This one gives me the fear
  that part2 is going all combinatorial and I can't see where there's scope for
  any simplifications/counting given the rules in play....
  * `python/day14part2.py` - Oh. Oh dear this is 2020 day 13 all over again. Beaten
  again by the lad both in time (...hours...) and solution (...I needed a hint
  on how to iterate against the rule-pairs to get there). Got my star but at
  what cost?
  * `python/day15part1.py` - And this is algorithmic-explosion between the sample
  data and the actual data. Nice. This is most easily solved by back-tracking from
  the finish calculating the cost-to-finish from there.
  * `python/day15part2.py` - So the bad news is that the algorithm I used for part 1
  not only doesn't work for part 2 but **shouldn't** have worked for part 1. Although
  it did find the same "optimal" solution for the example data in part 2. After hours
  of searching for bugs I decided  to cut my losses and do Dijkstra's Algorithm;
  after wasting more hours waiting for the slow-running algorithms to finish I finally
  found my "lost assumption" that explains how I got lucky for part 1 (_some_ input
  data can find the optimal solution using simpler connection rules, but not _all_
  input data is so lucky). At one point I had an implementation that completes in
  about 1/2 the time of the current version - mostly through faster selection of
  next-nearest-node - but endless hacking and tweaking and copy/paste/delete means
  it's lost forever. On the plus side, at least this time visualisation is [built in](https://www.guided-naafi.org/aoc2021/2021/12/15/VisualisationOfAOC2021Day15Part2.html)
    * **Updated** 2021-12-16 - Version now uses a faster sorted-hash-by-cost
    lookup for the next-in-queue selector which is about an order of magnitude faster
    (~5 minutes instead of ~60). Shower Thoughts, eh? Also knocked another minute
    off by,er, pruning the hash list on empty.
    * **Updated** 2021-12-17 - `python/day15part2_extracredit.py` - Tweaked the
    optimisations to knock another 10% off processing time, but also extended
    the visualisation to spit out a frame every X loops, which makes for a nice
    animation; it uses costs-so-far and path-so-far to make a very pretty looking
    "growth" animation; results in the [updated blog page](https://www.guided-naafi.org/aoc2021/2021/12/15/VisualisationOfAOC2021Day15Part2.html)
  * `python/day16part1.py` - Ah it's Packet Parsing Day. I wondered when that would
  come. And, surprise surprise it's nested-packets. And a weird request to boot.
  I'm not desperately proud of my answer here - the parsing and recursion is fine,
  but the fact that I'm manipulating global variables to track the message output
  and the version numbers is _awful_ code.... But, as with all other things, At
  Least It Works.
  * `python/day16part2.py` - I'm honestly not sure whether I'm proud of this or
  ashamed. On the plus side, it's a better way of parsing given arbitrary rules
  (one global variable, the message, with "stack" recursive replacement when
  single-type sub-packets are encountered). It would fail if back-tracking were
  required but it's not, so happy days. On the other hand, the pass-back of
  computed values is horribly hacky with no good way of distinguishing singles
  from lists. Hence the check-code. On the plus side, at least it's fast.
  * `python/day17part1.py` - **BRUTE FORCE AND IGNORANCE, BABY**. I was having
  too much fun playing around with Dijkstra algorithms to think about how to
  solve this _properly_ so instead find a purely-iterative throw-forward solution
  that is _amazingly_ inefficient. So inefficient is my approach is that when the
  web page told me my original answer was too low my "solution" was just to increase
  the throw-limits by a factor of 5 and try again. Which got me the right answer
  (but might not get you yours!)
  * `python/day17part2.py` - **BRUTE FORCE WITH THREADING**. The solution space
  for this one is _broadly_ the same as for part 1 but needs bigger "boundaries"
  to be sure all has been caught (the example data proves this; unlike part 1
  it's possible to succeed even if you start heading down). This being a lazy
  day I got my answer by just testing all possible trajectories in a very large
  (2000x2000) "box". While that was running I worked on the version here, which
  is multi-threaded using `concurrent.futures` and I then wasted about 10x the
  time the original took to run benchmarking `ProcessPoolExecutor` vs `ThreadPoolExecutor`
  and the right number of threads - see comments in the code for my findings, but
  `ThreadPoolExecutor` with `numThreads=2xnumCPUsAvailable` FTW. And, then,
  after _that_ and giving it a bit of thought plus some discussion reading on
  Le Reddit I implemented the boundary-shrinking conditions there which _significantly_
  reduce the search-space and thus runtime. Result is 4x faster than naïve and about
  6x faster than the version I used to _actually_ submit my response....
    * *Update 2021-12-18*: Shower Thoughtz this morning told me my threading approach
    was too naïve - the workload of a single trajectory wasn't big enough to justify
    the overhead. So instead chunk the list to be tested into `numThreads` blocks
    and spawn a "thread" or "process" for each chunk. _Voila_ there goes the
    weird result from yesterday _and_ here comes massive parallelism gainz. Best
    result now uses `ProcessPoolExecutor` with 24 threads and gets 10x speed up over
    the single-threaded case (even with optimisations, so well over 20x quicker than
    the brutest-of-force version I used to submit the actual result).
  * `python/day18part1.py` - I **HATED** this problem. When you analyse the
  input, the specification, you _try different representations_ and **then** end
  up deciding that "This is easiest if I treat this as a string and perform a series
  of string manipulations on it" you know you're either as thick as two short planks
  _or_ the problem's just pointlessly over-complicated. Anyway, here's Wonderwall.
  * `python/day18part2.py` - A "gimmie" after part1. Looks like it might go all
  combinatorial-explosion, but with the limited number in the input set, is actually
  not worth doing anything but a brute-force all-against-all comparison. So I Did.
  * `python/day19part1.py` - Absolute Clown Shoes. A complete curdled trifle of a
  solution. I was going to say "pathetic design but the implementation is OK" until
  I got about half way through the implementation and realised it was just a total
  anti-pattern. An incredibly inefficient implementation of a very poor solution
  design whose _only_ positive feature is that it is, after all, All My Own Work.
  OK OK I did use The Lad as (effectively) a Rubber Duck to talk through the
  required steps but I cannot blame him for _any_ of the mess that has ensued.
  This is by far the record for longest I've taken on any _part_ of a day's solution
  with thinking about it, off and on, for a whole week before getting my answer.
  * `python/day19part2.py` - A light refresher, really, after the pain of part one.
  Especially as I'd been using a vague analogue of "Manhattan Distance" in some of
  my failed attempts to tackle part one (hint: no, you _cannot_ ignore rotations
  when comparing probe pair distances in part one, although you *can* use a simpler
  length discriminator to narrow the search-space if you like). Anyway, a slight
  adaptation of the probe transform/merge logic worked to get scanners into a single
  coordinate system and from there the answer was trivial to arrive at.
  * `python/day20part1.py` - Happy New Year to all our reader!. Took a long break.
  Found this frustrating - sample data worked fine but the "live" data threw too
  big numbers, because it maps all-zeros to a 1 in the enhancement algorithm. After
  2 iterations this leaves a "border" around the image no matter how big it's scaled.
  The problem specification says "consider the image is infinite" which, I'd argue,
  leaves wriggle room there as to how to process it - *technically* the answer you
  have to give is "infinity" because an infinite sized image has an infinite border
  but that's clearly garbage. Solution is to over-grow the source image and clip it
  back by 1 after enhancement. That's frustrating.
  * `python/day20part2.py` - Needed a hint from the sub-reddit on how to handle the
  changing conditions of the input data (the clue being the "infinite border" doesn't
  initialise to zero _at every step_ because of the enhancement condition for all-zeros.)
  After that it was just a matter of getting the growth and clip factors correct, the
  output being juust small enough to fit on a screen to tell me there's a definite
  pattern in there. Mark today down as Frustrating, because it seemed like there was
  a _lot_ of interpretation of unstated requirements required to get there. Or I'm
  thick. One or the other.
  * `python/day21part1.py` - Oh god this was too easy, part 2 is going to be a nightmare....
  OK so I got some of my modular arithmetic wrong, I didn't read the full question before
  coding, and I wouldn't stand by the code quality. But it works fairly well and gives
  the right answer. Job Done.

## NodeJS / JavaScript
  * `node/day1part2.js` - Look, this is a straightforward non-idiomatic translation.
  (but it does work)
  * `node/day2part2.js` - Another transliteration of the python solution but I did
  make use of a `switch{}` statement (python's most obvious lacking feature)
  * `node/day3part2.js` - More of a straightforward transliteration than I was
  hoping for, but it does have the one-recursion-only optimisation. Not sure that
  makes much difference t.b.h....

## Go
  * `go/day1part2.go` - It's not exactly idiomatic but it is better structured and
  (by virtue of parameters) it can solve both part 1 and part 2 in a single program.
  * `go/day2part2.go` - More boilerplate conversion from the python version.
  * `go/day3part2.go` - Spent more time fighting type-conversions than I'd have thought
  was reasonable...

## Rust
  * `rust/day1part2.rs` - Again, this is a whatever-works answer. Rust's compiler
  is quite handy for suggesting work-arounds though. Very similar implementation
  and capabilities to the Go version, simpel testing suggests it's 3x faster
  to run, though...
  * `rust/day2part2.rs` - Same as Go,Javascript versions - a transliteration of
  the rather simple Python algorithm to it-compiles-it-must-be-valid Rust. There's
  more cargo-cult statements in this (copied off t'web) than I'm happy with.

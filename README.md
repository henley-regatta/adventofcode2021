# adventofcode2021

These are my answers for the [2021 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

I wasn't intending to take part in this after the time I wasted last year, but...
I quite like programming. I'm not good at it, but I enjoy it. So we'll see how we go.

Answers are structured by language (Python, Go, Rust) and named by day.
